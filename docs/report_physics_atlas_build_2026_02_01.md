# Report: Physics Atlas Build
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Author:** Antigravity

## 1. Summary
Created `docs/PHYSICS_ATLAS.md`, a centralized index that maps symptoms to the 10 distinct forensic docs (A–J) written during the Physics Unification.

## 2. Changes
*   **New Doc**: `docs/PHYSICS_ATLAS.md`
    *   Direct link to T1–T7 (Acceptance).
    *   A–J Map (Ownership, Inventory, Metrics, Repulsion, XPBD, Telemetry, Ghost, Mode, Startup, Acceptance).
    *   Symptom Router (e.g. "Values Explode" -> Doc E).
    *   Binding Laws (Hard invariants).
*   **Updated**: `AGENTS.md`
    *   Replaced generic "Read physics_xray.md" with **"STOP. Read docs/PHYSICS_ATLAS.md first."**

## 3. Discovered Links (The A–J Map)
All required docs exist and are now indexable:
*   [A] `docs/forensic_node_xy_write_ownership.md`
*   [B] `docs/forensic_sharp_inventory.md`
*   [C] `docs/forensic_native_ledger.md`
*   [D] `docs/forensic_repulsion_placement_and_scaling.md`
*   [E] `docs/forensic_dt_and_xpbd_compliance_alignment.md`
*   [F] `docs/forensic_xpbd_proof_of_life_telemetry.md`
*   [G] `docs/forensic_ghost_velocity_reconcile_compat.md`
*   [H] `docs/forensic_mode_isolation_hybrid_vs_xpbd.md`
*   [I] `docs/forensic_spawn_startup_hygiene.md`
*   [J] `docs/acceptance_good_springmass_in_hand.md`

## 4. Evaluation
The atlas allows a new agent to go from "It feels weird" to "Check `springCorrMax` in Doc J" in under 30 seconds.
