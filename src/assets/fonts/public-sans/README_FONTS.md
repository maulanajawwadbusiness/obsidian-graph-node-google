# Missing Fonts: Public Sans

The application expects Public Sans (Bold 700) to be present in this directory for non-Windows devices.

Please download **Public Sans** (specifically the Bold weight) and place the files here:

- `src/assets/fonts/public-sans/PublicSans-Bold.woff2` (Preferred)
- `src/assets/fonts/public-sans/PublicSans-Bold.woff`
- `src/assets/fonts/public-sans/PublicSans-Bold.ttf`

You can download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans) or the [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/typography/typeface/).
